# Style Guide

This document provides brief stylistic guidance on markdown documents that are part of *⿻數位 Plurality*.  

## Structure

### Terminology 

The largest division within the book (of which there are 7 in the core, plus prefatory material and blurb), are referred to as "Parts".

Within these, there are usually several "Chapters"; within each chapter there are "Sections" and ocassionally there may be "Subsections" within sections, though these should be avoided except where absolutely necessary.

### Numeration

Both parts and chapters number from 0, with 0 denoting prefatory material to the core elements of whatever level.

### Demarcation

Titles of Chapters are set off by a singled "#" symbol; titles of sections are set off by a triple "###" symbol; titles of subsections are set off by a quadrupule"####".

### Capitalization

Chapter titles are fully capitalized; only the first letter of sections are titled.

## Justification

Paragraphs are not indented.

## Divisions

Chapters in Parts 2-7 all begin with some sort of introductory material before the main substances of the chapter which is homogeneous in a Part and varies across Parts (e.g. Part 4 chapters all begin with an illustration of a currently deployed technology illustrating the idea of the chapter).  This opening material should be separated from the rest of the text by "---".

### Internal referencing

When referencing Parts, Sections or Chapters, use their titles in quotes such as "In the Part of the book on 'Freedom'" or "In our chapter 'The Lost Dao'".

### Grammar

We use Oxford commas.

### Figures

Figures should include both a descriptive alt text and a caption formated as below and showing source, should be labeled by Chapter and letter also as shown below.  Intra-chapter references should use letter only; e.g. "Figure A shows..."
