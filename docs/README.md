## Welcome to the docs repository for the Plurality project!

Within this repository, you will find markdown files that contain information about the project, instructions on how to contribute, recommendations on creating you own copy of the project, and more.

Feel free to browse the markdown files in this repository to find what that you need. However, if you would like to view the content in a more user friendly way, the docs are also hosted on an external site.

The docs site can be accessed here: [https://gardenenigma.github.io/plurality-docs/](https://gardenenigma.github.io/plurality-docs/)

The site is updated periodically with content from the markdown files found in this repository. Feel free to use the site as needed.
