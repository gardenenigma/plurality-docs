# Welcome to the Plurality Docs

> *Plurality* is an open, git-based collaborative book project that aims to offer a vision for the future of technology focused around empowering and bridging social difference.

On this site you will find information about the *Plurality* book project and its governance, instructions on how to contribute to the project, recommendations on creating you own copy of the project, and more.

The initial maintainers of the *Plurality* book project are Audrey Tang, [Taiwan's digital minister](https://moda.gov.tw/en/), and [E. Glen Weyl](https://www.glenweyl.com). However, we plan to progressively decentralize control of the project using a new git-native formal governance protocol using blockchain-like affordances called [Gov4Git](https://github.com/gov4git/gov4git). After physical copies of the book have been printed we plan to transition the project to full community control.

All material in the *Plurality* book project is [CC0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license). If we made a mistake, take it as an invitation.  If you feel we are wrong, set us straight.  If we are not speaking in the language of your community, create a version that does.  If you don't want to deal with the community, the material has no copyright so take anything you want and leave the rest.  

Before you get started with the docs, you might want to check out the *Plurality* book which can be found at [plurality.net](https://www.plurality.net/), or say 'Hi' to the community by sending a message introducing yourself on our [community discord](https://discord.gg/YWSDRqdW5n).

Ask not, "Why is nobody doing this?" You are the nobody.
