# Governance introduction

> The ideas described in Plurality aim to tell the world how collaborative technology can remake how we work and govern together. The Plurality community also aims show how these ideas can work in practice.

To do this, the Plurality book will be built using the principles that are described in the book. This is a challenge because it is a book about innovation and thus the platforms for the things we want to show do not exist: we are building them as we go in the process of writing the book!

## Governance goals

We have several interlocking goals in the design of our management system:

1. **We want to recognize project contributions formally, quantitatively, and democratically.** This can be contrasted to the informal and often confusing methods that are typical to open-source projects.
2. **We want to avoid speculation and financialization** of the devices that will be used to recognize contributions to the project.
3. **We want to demonstrate the ideas of Plurality.** To do this, we will aim to ensure that the direction of the project is determined democratically. Eventually, we want to turn over the maintenance of the project to the community completely.
4. **We want the project to scale smoothly while also ensuring that the systems we use are secured against malicious attacks.** We want to ensure that democratization and decentralization happens gradually and does not occur at the expensive of the integrity of the project’s contents or the community’s values.
