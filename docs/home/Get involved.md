# Get involved

> Work in progress

## Join us!

We hope youâ€™ll be excited to join us! You need PCs to really get into the heart of the system. The simplest way in is to submit a PR on a currently outstanding issue. Community members can also create an issue that they fund just to get you access; if your submission is approved (if the community collectively thinks you should join) you will become a member with the bounty associated with that issue. If you wish to know the current priority of issues but are not yet a member, you can contact a current member (such as [Glen Weyl](mailto:glen@plurlaity.net)). Please join our Discord channel to discuss and reach out to [Petar Maymounkov](mailto:petar@gov4git.org) if you are a translation fork or other affiliated community that wishes to use this workflow.
