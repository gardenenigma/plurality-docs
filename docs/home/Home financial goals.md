# Financial goals

> We have no aspiration to earn any financial return on any aspect of the project, and in fact are spending some personal resources to make it possible.  

However, there are elements of the project that may require financial support (e.g. promotion and distribution of the physical book) and many of the volunteers in the community may decide it is appropriate they be compensated for some part of the time they devote to the work.  

We are committed to putting all base materials into the public domain and it is core to this project to avoid it becoming financialized or speculative.  At the same time,  we believe that there are ways that are not only consistent with our values but illustrative of them to help raise funds to the extent they become relevant.  We welcome ideas from the community on this; some preliminary thoughts of ours include:

1. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are issued along with physical copies of the book and allow the book to sell at a premium despite the lack of copyright.
2. Raising funds through a Quadratic Funding grant on platforms such as GitCoin.
3. Using partial common ownership/Harberger tokens to gate access to scarce associated resources (like Glen's consulting and speaking time).
4. Issuing credentials and SoulBound Tokens to both direct financial contributors and those who fund the project through GitCoin.

We plan to pursue these approaches and to put any funds raised into the collective control of the community, after any necessary expenditures to ensure physical printing and distribution of the book are completed.  We understand this will require appropriate legal steps to ensure compliance with organizational forms and standard in relevant jurisdictions and we plan to undertake these in the coming months, possibly with the assistance of the Open Collective Foundation.
