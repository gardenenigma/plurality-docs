We strongly encourage translations, both to other languages and to other cultural genres, whether in terms of formatting (fiction, journalism, etc.) or to different communities (religious, ethnic, disciplinary, etc.).  While these "forks" can do whatever they wish with this public domain material, we plan to link to and "recognize" only a smaller group of projects that align to the root in terms of content, values, management style and copyrights. We hope this link and roots will remain relevant and respected because of the legitimacy this community will achieve through its principles and writing.
